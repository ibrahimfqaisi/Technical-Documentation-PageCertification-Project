            <article>
                <p> Code documentation is the process through which software programmers document their code. It is a
                    combination
                    of clear pictures and textual explanations that describe what a codebase does and how it may be
                    used. It
                    enhances code readability, reproducibility, and usability.</p>
                <P> Code documentation can take the form of straightforward explanations of code functions and blocks, a
                    comprehensive developer handbook that includes dos and don'ts, summaries of every aspect of the
                    application,
                    illustrative images such as sequence and entity relationship diagrams, writing API documentation,
                    describing
                    each class, method, argument and return value, and even a ReadME file. </P>

            <header>Why Should You Document Your Code</header>
            <article>
                <p>Why should your code be documented? What advantages does code documentation offer you? Why do you
                    still need
                    to describe your preferences and how you implemented the code when coding is difficult enough? </p>
                <p>Three factors should motivate you towards documenting code:</p>
                <h4>New Skills</h4>
                <p>All parties participating in the SDLC interact and communicate using technical documentation as the
                    channel. Since you are not the only person working on the SDLC, you must communicate with both
                    technical and non-technical audiences. Therefore, it is crucial to be able to communicate with other
                    software developers both inside and outside of your organization, as well as with other SDLC
                    stakeholders, as you serve as the backbone of the process. By adding this flair of communication to
                    your code, documentation can help you improve your technical communication abilities and, in turn,
                    increase your employability.</p>
                <h4>Documentation Increases the Usability of Your Code</h4>
                <p>Code that is documented is reused. Its documentation often makes the difference between a code
                    library being used and not. Nobody wants to make a contribution to or use an undocumented
                    open-source project.

                    Most of the time, you'd prefer to use a less powerful library with documentation. Why? Considering
                    that a codebase's documentation has more information. The project's developers think it's worthwhile
                    to explain how it works and why important decisions were made in straightforward language so that
                    anyone who might be interested can easily get started. It can be quite thrilling and enjoyable to
                    discover a brand-new, intriguing, and thoroughly described project in your preferred programming
                    language.</p>

            <header>How Do You Write a Documented Code</header>
            <article>
                <p>These fundamental guidelines will help you produce meaningful and, most importantly, accessible code
                    documentation. </p>
                <h4>Write Clean Code </h4>
                <p>As apparent as it may seem, developing effective, clean code must come before writing any
                    documentation. It is impossible to document ambiguous, improperly formatted code without a well
                    defined purpose and structure. Inability to understand your code without comments may be a sign that
                    it needs to be simplified or refactored into more manageable chunks.</p>
                <p>Be careful to build a logical and manageable folder structure when developing production-level code,
                    and adhere to relevant naming standards for files, variables, and functions throughout the project.
                    Additionally, remove repetitive code. Another technique to guarantee that your code is clear and
                    tidy is to format it according to the same standards throughout the project or code implementation.
                <h4>Here is an example of clean code:</h4>
                <code>  def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the average of a list of numbers.
    """
    if not numbers:
        return None
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total / len(numbers)
</code>
                <h4>other example of clean code:</h4>
                <code>// Unclear variable name
  let x = 5;
  
  // Clear variable name
  let numberOfStudents = 5;
  </code>
                <h4>other example of clean code:</h4>

                <code>// Unclean function
  function calculateSum(a, b, c, d) {
    let sum = a + b + c + d;
    return sum;
  }
  
  // Clean function
  function calculateSum(numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr);
  }
  </code>
                <h4>other example of clean code:</h4>

                <code>// Unclear code without comments
  function calculateAverage(numbers) {
    let sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr);
    let average = sum / numbers.length;
    return average;
  }
  
  // Clean code with comments
  function calculateAverage(numbers) {
    // Calculate the sum of all numbers
    let sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr);
  
    // Calculate the average of all numbers
    let average = sum / numbers.length;
  
    return average;
  }
  </code>
                <h4>other example of clean code:</h4>

                <code>// Unclean code with hardcoded values
  function calculateCircleArea(radius) {
    let pi = 3.14;
    let area = pi * radius * radius;
    return area;
  }
  
  // Clean code with constants
  const PI = 3.14;
  
  function calculateCircleArea(radius) {
    let area = PI * radius * radius;
    return area;
  }
  
  </code>
                <h4>other points to consider when writing clean code: </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select the Right Tools</li>
                    <li>Document As You Write </li>
                    <li>Structure Your Comments Well </li>
                    <li>Add Docstrings
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid hardcoding values and use constants instead:</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The advantages of having excellent code documentation are both individual and collective; in addition
                    to facilitating developer collaboration, it also helps you improve your technical writing and
                    documentation skills.</p>
                <p>Some coding concepts, such as the Don't Repeat Yourself rule, also apply to writing code
                    documentation because duplication is detested even in code documentation. In addition to
                    well-formatted docstrings and regular updates to your readme file, excellent code documentation also
                    involves a number of best practices covered in this blog.</p>
